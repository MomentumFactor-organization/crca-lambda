# Branches

I consider it necessary to detail the use of branches in this repository since it is not the traditional use.

The branches that are being used are:

```
- main
- develop
- staging
- production
```

For this, the development, staging, and production branches are being used for the corresponding environments. The main branch is not being used for the production environment because the plans for the environments are saved in that branch in case of loss. It could be said that it is the branch where the information for all the branches is saved.
